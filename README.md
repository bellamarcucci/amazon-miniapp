# Rufus Mini Interaction Demo

This is a lightweight mobile-only web demo created to simulate how an AI shopping assistant inspired by Amazon’s “Ask Rufus” could help users move from confusion to confidence while shopping online.

The experience is designed for classroom presentations and live demos using a QR code, allowing students to interact directly on their phones.

## Purpose

The mini app demonstrates:

- How shoppers hesitate when comparing similar products
- How unanswered product questions block purchases
- How conversational interfaces reduce friction
- How AI-powered assistants can guide decisions

It is intended for discussions around ecommerce UX, conversational search, and AI in digital products.

## How It Works

The app contains four screens:

1. Two similar products with unclear performance
2. A product care question about a comforter
3. A recommendation prompt about headphones under $50
4. A final reveal screen introducing Rufus

Navigation is handled using HTML anchors and CSS `:target` selectors. No JavaScript is required.
